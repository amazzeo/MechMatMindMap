# MechMatMindMap
Welcome to our course on undergraduate mechanics of materials. The goal is to crowd-source all the information you would need to learn and understand the concepts taught in a standard university/college level course for mechanical or engineering undergraduates. This work incomplete and ongoing.
# Using Freeplane
The zip file includes a mind map created in Freeplane (https://www.freeplane.org/), along with a folder MechMatMindMap_Files that contains media files referenced in the mind map.
